# Seattle-Weather
Analyzing Seattle weather patterns to predict the probability of rain on any given day.
Will use several different machine learning methods. 

seattle_weather_helper.py unpacks data. you will need to change variable data_dir = '/Users/dylanrutter/Downloads/seattleweather.csv' to fit your own save path

seattle_weather_classifiers.py compares several different SciKit Learn Modules including K nearest neighbors, decision trees, SVC, NuSVC, random forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Descent boosting, and GaussianNB 

seattle_weather_tf.py uses a TensorFlow neural network to analyze the data
